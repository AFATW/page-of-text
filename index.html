            <p>I've had dealt with enough stress, after a shitty individual named may harassed me and 5 other people, i just felt depressed enough,
                I Remember... Back in 2022 when i posted good videos and it brought back so many memories, when i wasn't banned from Slap Battles, when my main Discord Account was still here but now... everything changed... my main account has been terminated, Adults like the shitty individual ms. may hate kids... I miss everything the was it was... I want to go back to the old 2022 life i've had, my old computer, i've had a dream of having it, my old stuff... ITS ALL FUCKING GONE!!! why does it have to be this way??? why??? if i have to then i would probably make this a website but here in 2023,, i found a person who actually accepts me as a kid on discord, he held his hand towards me like Jesus did when i was constantly getting hated by teenagers and adults, but he is different, he is a teenager and his name is Oof, of course i'm not going to say his real name of course but he is my true friend. But i really think kids shouldn't be treated like shit, i fell into depression after this but i'm still not going to give up on trying to get the word out of ms.may, but if you guys are trying to friend me then i've turned off my friend requests because of the super retarded people who keep trying to friend me, what such cowards. I really cannot believe 2023 bro, When 2024 comes, i'm gonna try to get you guys an apartment but 2022 was sooooooooooo much better
